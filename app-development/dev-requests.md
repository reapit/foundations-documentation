# Development requests

To request a new feature or report a bug, please visit the help section of the developer portal. You'll be directed to GitHub where you'll be able to create an issue directly in our public board. You should track the progress of your issue and communicate with developer directly in GitHub.

## Our processes

After submitting an issue, your ticket will get triaged and categorised. From here, it will be assigned to the relevant GitHub project, depending on the nature of the work requested.

### Back end

Issues that align to back end engineering \(such as our REST APIs and webhooks\) will be managed using [Scrum Agile Framework](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum) using a two week sprint cycle. 

* Incoming issues that we identify as back end engineering will be given the `back end` label and assigned to the [Back end backlog](https://github.com/reapit/foundations/projects/6) public board
* New issues in the board are reviewed weekly as part of our backlog refinement sessions. To ensure your issue can be progressed quickly, please provide as much relevant information as possible.
* The team will discuss each issue and should we agree that development is warranted, we will commit to the work
* The issue will then enter our backlog and be prioritised against the needs of other customers and developers
* If we identity an issue as short term goal, we'll assess the effort required and outline a technical specification - please take the time to review this detail
* When we're ready to schedule the issue, it will be assigned to a [dated GitHub project board](https://github.com/reapit/foundations/projects) for that particular sprint where you can continue to track it's progress to completion
