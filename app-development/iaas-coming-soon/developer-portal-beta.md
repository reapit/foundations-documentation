# ðŸ–¥ Developer Portal (Beta)

If you prefer a GUI to manage your deployments over a terminal based CLI, you can manage this from within the Developer Portal itself. When you have been enabled as part of the public beta, you will see both a top level navigation item `IaaS`, that gives you an overview dashboard of your pipelines, plus, each app has a Pipeline configuration page.

### Getting Started

The first step to deploy an app is to visit the app detail page in the developer portal at `/apps/:id` If you are part of the beta and have pipelines enabled, you will see a new "Pipelines" menu item for your client side authenticated apps.

When you create a new application, we pre-provision a Pipeline for your application by default. For apps that pre-exist the IaaS service, this was not possible so you will see this screen:

From here you should hit "Create Pipeline" to take you to the new pipeline page.

From here, you need to tell us about your application, the repo (we support Github and BitBucket), the main branch, the command in your package.json that builds the app and the directory your assets are output to.

On saving this config, you have pre-provisioned an app and you will see the following screen.&#x20;

At this point, you should visit the configure tab, to  complete the build details, in the same format as the "New Pipeline" page above.

When you have done this, if your app is on Github and private, you will need to install our Github App from this page: [https://github.com/apps/reapit](https://github.com/apps/reapit) following the steps to configure for your repo. This gives us the permission to pull from your private repo.

{% hint style="info" %}
You should only install the Github app for a single repo, not your whole organisation as it sets up a webhook on an app by app basis. If you delete your app or pipeline, and set up a new one for your repo, you need to uninstall and re-install the Github app each time.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Having installed the app, you are ready to do your first build. Hit the "provision" button and the page will start to update in live time as we pull, build and deploy your code.

And that's it! On completion of all the steps, you can then visit your deployed application using the Location Link.

### Pipeline Dashboard

From the top level nav you can also view the IaaS pipeline dashboard that gives you an overview of the current statuses of all your app pipelines. By expanding each row, you have quick links to the deployed app, your Pipeline config and the recent app deployments.

### Troubleshooting&#x20;

We will try to update this section regularly with frequently asked questions while we are in beta.

* **My deployment fails immediately after hitting provision then deploy with a private repo.**  First check you have the Github app installed. Then check you have installed for a single repo, not your whole organisation as it sets up a webhook on an app by app basis. If you delete your app or pipeline, and set up a new one for your repo, you need to uninstall and re-install the Github app each time.&#x20;
* **My deployment throws an error after hitting provision then deploy.** We validate your repo's existence before trying to pull it. It is likely therefore you have not configured your app from the configure tab.
* **My deployment fails at one of the build steps.** This is likely because of an issue building you app itself. Check the download logs button in the expandable pipeline table row for build errors and check if you can replicate locally.
* **My app deployed but I see a re-direct mismatch error when first clicking on the link.** We update your app re-direct uris when provisioning a pipeline however, if this fails you may need to update them manually to the location of your deployed app from the `apps/:id/edit` page,  authentication tab.
