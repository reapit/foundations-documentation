### **I have a question not covered in the documentation?**

We take great pride in ensuring our documentation is as comprehensive and detailed as possible. However, there may be an instance in which you are unable to find the information you need. As we do not provide technical support via email or over the phone, please use the ‘[Question](https://github.com/reapit/foundations/issues/new?assignees=\&labels=needs-triage%2C+question\&template=question.md\&title=)’ template to raise an issue. Please note, it's important that you read the documentation before asking a question as we cannot answer questions which are already covered.
