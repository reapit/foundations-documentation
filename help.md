**How do I request a new feature or report a bug?**&#x20;

The process depends on the impact level of your request. Full details of response and resolution times can be found in the [Partner Business Services Catalogue (BSC)](https://www.reapit.com/legal/terms-and-conditions/reapit-partner-business-service-catalogue)

Critical (P1) or High (P2) issues \
Log a ticket via the Reapit Service Desk Portal: [https://reapitsupport.refined.site/](https://reapitsupport.refined.site/)&#x20;

* Select the correct impact level and product type as ‘Reapit API’ so your request is routed to the right team.&#x20;
* Please note: Reapit will downgrade issues that are incorrectly logged as P1 or P2. Penalties will apply in line with Schedule 4 of the Developer Portal Terms & Conditions.&#x20;
* New users will need to create an account. Setup guidance is here: [https://reapit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RW/pages/1432912084/Using+the+Reapit+Service+Desk+Portal](https://reapit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RW/pages/1432912084/Using+the+Reapit+Service+Desk+Portal)&#x20;

Medium (P3) or Low (P4) issues, and all feature requests \
Email [partners@reapit.com](mailto:partners@reapit.com). The Partnerships team will validate your request and, if appropriate, log a ticket on your behalf and provide a ticket reference number.&#x20;
