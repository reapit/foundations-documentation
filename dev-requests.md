# Development Requests

From **August 23rd, 2024,** all bugs and feature requests relating to the DeveloperPortal and Platform APIs will need to be raised through our centralised [Reapit Support Platform](https://reapitsupport.refined.site/login) (Jira) and no longer through GitHub.&#x20;

**Existing GitHub issues**&#x20;

We will migrate all our existing tickets (if applicable) to the new Reapit Support Platform. If more information or clarification is needed before the ticket can be migrated, we will contact you via the contact section.

We will give each migrated ticket an internal reference. You can use this reference and/or the GitHub issue number on any new tickets you raise (if you want to follow up on an existing issue).&#x20;

Whilst the GitHub public board will no longer be visible, all issues and tickets will still be retained for future reference. &#x20;

&#x20;

**Creating a ticket:**

1. **Reapit Customers:** The process for logging tickets relating to the DeveloperPortal and/or the Platform API is now the same as you do for other services provided by Reapit. Log into the Reapit Support Platform via direct link or through the Reapit CRM support link.
2. **Developers/Third-parties**: To log a ticket, please visit: [https://reapitsupport.refined.site/login](https://reapitsupport.refined.site/login). If you are a new user, you will need set up an account. For more information on the setup process, please click [here](https://reapit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RW/pages/1432912084/Using+the+Reapit+Service+Desk+Portal). Please ensure you select the correct product type associated to your request to ensure itâ€™s associated to the correct service.\

   **Related Product types:**\
   \- Reapit Connect\
   \- Reapit API\
   \- Data Warehouse/Analytics Schema

We will only accept tickets relating to feature requests or bugs. For questions relating to our Public API's or the DeveloperPortal, please review the support section below.

**Ongoing Visibility**

When you create a ticket on the Reapit Support Portal, you will be notified by email as the ticket progresses (comments made/status updates, etc.). You also have the option of adding additional subscribers when logging your ticket who can also be notified during the ticket progression. The status of any tickets you have raised will also be visible when you log in to the portal under the 'My Open Tickets' section at the bottom of the home page.\
&#x20;

**Feature Visibility**

The 'What's New' updates and GitHub Milestones will no longer be part of the Foundation's documentation, and the Product Team will communicate future features and functionality. &#x20;
