description: Welcome to Reapit Foundations Documentation

# Home

The documentation is split between the[ API](api/) and our [Open Source Packages](app-development/).

API usage documentation is again split between the [Foundations REST API](https://marketplace.reapit.cloud/developer/api-docs) for querying the Reapit data platform, the[ Desktop API](api/desktop-api.md) which is relevant to interactions between web-apps and [Reapit Agency Cloud](https://www.reapit.com/agency-cloud/), the [Reapit Connect OAuth](api/reapit-connect.md) single sign on service, and finally, the [NPM packages](https://www.npmjs.com/org/reapit) we support for [web development.](app-development/web.md)

In the Open Source docs you will find information, largely about the [Foundations Repo on Github](https://github.com/reapit/foundations). This is the home for all the source code for our web apps, tooling and published packages.&#x20;
