# App Permissions

Requesting a new permission when your app is already in use (live and installed)

**Step 1:**

Add the new permissions and click ‘Create Revision’.

**Step 2:**

A modal will appear presenting you with the option to ‘Send Requests’. If you choose to send the requests, an email will be sent to the person that installed your app.

Each customer will have to agree to the new permission before our team can approve your revision.

You can track this process on the ‘App Consents’ page or reach out to your customer to expedite their response to our message.

If you decide not to send the requests, our Admin team will send the requests.&#x20;

Please see an example email the customer will receive:

“Dear ‘CUSTOMER ORGANISATION’,

An App you have installed from the AppMarket ‘YOUR APP NAME’ has requested the following additional permissions to your data:
