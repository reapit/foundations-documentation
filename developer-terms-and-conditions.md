#### 2.3 Working with other developers&#x20;

2.3.2 The Developer must not in any manner or by any means:&#x20;

(a) facilitate or permit any third party to access or use Data; or&#x20;

outside an Approved Application and the purposes of that Approved Application. &#x20;

#### 2.4 Application Development-Requirements&#x20;

2.4.1 Each Application must be developed in accordance with:&#x20;

2.5.2 The Developer must submit the relevant Application to Reapit by completing the “Submit the Application” (or equivalent) process within the Platform.&#x20;

2.5.3 Upon receipt of the submission, Reapit will review the Application (which may include, at Reapit’s sole discretion, a full code review) and either:&#x20;

(a) approve the Application outright, in which case Reapit will notify the Developer electronically that the Application is an Approved Application and the Approved Application will be published by Reapit on the App Marketplace in accordance with Reapit’s usual processes; or &#x20;

(b) notify the Developer of any remedial actions or further development work required by Reapit (whether in relation to scope, functionality, or description) before the Application can be resubmitted for approval; or &#x20;

(c) notify the Developer, at Reapit’s sole discretion, that the Application is not approved and that Reapit does not wish to proceed any further with that Application. &#x20;

2.5.4 If Reapit requires remedial work or further development, in accordance with clause 2.5.3(b), the Developer must resubmit the Application in accordance with clause 2.5.2 or as otherwise directed by Reapit and the terms of clause 2.5.3 will apply to any re-submission.&#x20;

2.5.5 For the avoidance of doubt, no Application will be listed by Reapit in the App Marketplace unless it has been explicitly approved by Reapit in writing and such approval will never be deemed. &#x20;

#### 2.6 Reapit’s Right of Approvals and Review-After First Approval&#x20;

2.6.1 Notwithstanding that an Application has been approved by Reapit in accordance with the terms of clause 2.5, Reapit reserves the right to:&#x20;

(a) require that an Approved Application (or any part thereof) be re-submitted for approval in accordance with the terms of clause 2.5.4 if Reapit: &#x20;

2.7 A breach by the Developer of any term of this clause 2 will be deemed to be a material breach and will entitle Reapit to charge Administration Fees. &#x20;

2.8 For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement does not restrict Reapit, its affiliates, or its partners from: &#x20;

(a) offering, developing, or promoting products or services that may compete with any Developer Application; or &#x20;

2.9 The Developer agrees that during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of six (6) months following termination, the Developer must not, directly or indirectly: &#x20;

(a) solicit or attempt to solicit for employment, hire, or otherwise engage any Reapit employees, contractors, or subcontractors; &#x20;

3.1 Reapit will calculate the Fees in accordance with Schedules 2 and 4, and invoice the Fees to the Developer in accordance with this clause 3. The Developer must pay Reapit the Fees. The Fees will not include value added tax or any locally applicable equivalent sales tax, which the Developer must pay in addition to the Fees at the prevailing rate, and in the manner prescribed by applicable law. Without prejudice to the foregoing, Reapit reserves the right to invoice the Developer for any API calls in excess of the Monthly API Call Limit set out in Schedule 2.&#x20;

3.2 Fees will be collected by direct debit in accordance with the Direct Debit mandate that the Developer must complete at the same time as providing the Registration Details.&#x20;

3.3 If the Developer wishes to dispute all or part of an invoice, the Developer must:&#x20;

3.3.2 pay any undisputed part by the due date.&#x20;

3.4 Upon receipt of the notice from Developer pursuant to clause 3.3.1, the Parties must commence discussing the dispute in good faith for a period of 30 days and if the dispute is not resolved at the end of such period, it will be referred to the Dispute Resolution Procedure.&#x20;

3.5 Without prejudice to any other right or remedy Reapit may have, and subject to the terms of clause 3.3, if the Developer fails to pay Reapit the Fees on or before the due date in respect of a valid and undisputed invoice, Reapit may charge interest on such sum from the due date for payment at the annual rate of 5% above the base lending rate from time to time of Barclays Bank accruing on a daily basis until payment is made whether before or after any judgment.&#x20;

3.6 Notwithstanding the foregoing, Reapit reserves the right to vary the Fees (or any element of the Fees, such as the thresholds applicable to the “Number of Endpoints” or “Monthly API Calls” which are used to calculate the Total Consumption Cost), provided that Reapit must notify the Developer 60 days prior to such change taking effect. Following receipt of such notice from Reapit, the Developer has the right to terminate this Agreement by written notice to Reapit, such notice to be received by Reapit no later than 30 days prior the change taking effect. &#x20;

3.7 The Developer must pay the Minimum Guarantee in respect of each Approved Application as set out in Schedule 2.&#x20;

(c) confirmation that the Developer’s Applications comply with approved permissions and usage policies. &#x20;
