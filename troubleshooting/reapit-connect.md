# Reapit Connect

## **Reapit Connect**

### **Error: “Redirect Mismatch”**

* Check you have provided the correct Redirect URL\(s\) and Signout URL\(s\) on your app listing. When a user logs in, Reapit Connect will need to know where to direct the user. This is your Redirect URL\(s\). Reapit Connect will also need to know where to route your user if they logout. This is your Signout URL\(s\).

To test your application locally, you can provide the following \(example\):

**Redirect URI:** http://localhost:8080

**Signout URI:** [http://localhost:8080/login](http://localhost:8080/login)
